Currently I work as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University/[NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov). During my graduate programs at the [Virginia Institute of Marine Science](https://www.vims.edu), I used observations and numerical models to study how physical and biogeochemical processes affect hypoxia and acidification in coastal and estuarine systems. Specifically, my work involved (1) the impact of different sources of nutrients on Chesapeake hypoxia, (2) the impact of local human activities and global climate change on Chesapeake Bay carbonate system from daily to decadal time scales, and (3) translating the research into usable and actionable information for stakeholders via outreach activities. In the future, I plan to pursue a research and mentoring position in marine environmental science.

**_1. Response of Chesapeake Bay hypoxia and carbonate system to global and local drivers_**
  
  Hypoxia and acidification are two phenomena severely threatening the coastal environment and both are critical for stakeholders whose livelihoods depend on the health of these waters. My M.S. research focused on developing and applying coupled physical-biogeochemical models to investigate the impact of two often-neglected sources of nitrogen—direct atmospheric nitrogen deposition and continental shelf nitrogen fluxes—on Chesapeake Bay hypoxia, and comparing these impacts to those of changing nitrogen concentrations in the rivers. This work is published in Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans and received the VIMS Best Student Paper Award.

  For my Ph.D. research partially funded by a Mid-Atlantic Sea Grant / NOAA Ocean Acidification Program Graduate Research Fellowship, I use similar tools to those I used for my M.S., but this time to investigate a less studied water quality issue in the Chesapeake Bay: coastal acidification. One of the knowledge gaps I addressed was that the complex trends of Chesapeake Bay acidification over the past three decades are controlled by multiple global- and local-scale drivers. To better understand how these trends differ seasonally and spatially, I combined long-term water quality data analyses and numerical model simulations. This study, published in Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, suggests that the spatiotemporal variability of decadal changes in the Chesapeake Bay carbonate system (CO2-system) is much greater than that observed in the open ocean, due to a combination of influences from the watershed, atmosphere and ocean.

**_2. Carboante system variability in tidal tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay_**

  Dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity dynamics in tidal tributaries are sensitive to multiple ocean and watershed drivers, including tidal cycles and inputs from wetlands and rivers. However, development and application of numerical models that simultaneously address these drivers are limited. I helped develop a 120m horizontal resolution 3-D coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model forced with empirical inputs from tidal wetlands to investigate controls on the carbonate system in the York River Estuary, a small tributary of the Chesapeake Bay. Model results show that on average, wetland inputs account for 27% and 20% of the total DIC and TA inputs to the estuary, respectively, and double estuarine CO2 outgassing relative to a simulation without wetlands. Strong quasi-monthly variability in DIC and TA is driven by tidal cycles, which cause fluctuations between net heterotrophy and net autotrophy. This study shows that carbonate chemistry in tidal tributaries experiences complex transformations due to rivers, tidal wetlands, and tides; considering all three drivers are essential for investigating coastal carbon and alkalinity cycling.

  These relatively shallow regions are important sites for the shellfish aquaculture industry as well as oyster restoration, and could be more susceptible to coastal acidification due to terrestrial runoff and climate change. Therefore, I further investigated the impact of extreme river discharge and climate change on calcium carbonate saturation state (Ω) in the YRE. Model results show that year-to-year differences in river discharge produce differences in Ω that are comparable in magnitude to the long-term reductions in Ω projected to occur over the next 50 years. Although a similar high discharge event in the future will have 20–40% less of an impact on Ω, increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> will decrease baseline Ω. Shallow regions in the lower YRE, where most oyster reefs are located, typically recover faster after a high discharge event compared to regions farther upstream.

**_3. Collaborative research_**
 
  I have been actively involved in multiple collaborative projects throughout my graduate studies. Efforts regarding biogeochemical model improvements led to two publications, with one studying the impact of future climate change and nutrient reductions on Chesapeake Bay hypoxia, and the other one focusing on the drivers and extent of Chesapeake Bay warming over the past three decades. Additionally, I participated in multiple observational studies on Chesapeake Bay acidification, resulting in three co-authored publications led by researchers from VIMS, CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (Australia), and the Pennsylvania State University. Because of my interest in estuarine hydrodynamics, I attended the Estuarine & Coastal Fluid Dynamics Summer School at the University of Washington, and worked in a group to collect field measurements, to analyze numerical model outputs, and to write a report on tides, mixing, and exchange in the San Juan Channel, WA. Specifically, I used model outputs to compute net tidal energy flux, buoyancy flux and dissipation within the San Juan Channel.
